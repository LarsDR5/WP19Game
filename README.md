4 On A Row

This project is all about a game called "4 op een rij", a.k.a. Connect Four.
The game is for two players. 

A JSON-file is made for every game between two players for saving the gamestate.
This consist of a 5 by 5 array, with eiter a 0 (empty), 1 (player one) or a 2 (player 2) in every part of the 2D-array.

AJAX is used to save and open the gamestate in the JSON. 

On the main screen the user is able to start a game with a random person, generate a code to give to a friend, or fill in a code. 

A possible extension is a leaderboard, where a user gets a point for every game won.
Another possible extension is different themes from which the players can choose, e.g. Minecraft or Anime.
